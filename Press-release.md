 The following press release template is designed to collapse the 
 "Legitimacy Laundering" narrative by explicitly linking the Nobel Peace Prize to the military-enforced resource extraction.

This document should be released simultaneously with the service of the letters to the CalPERS and NYSCRF boards in early February.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Indigenous Coalition and Legal Partners Expose “Extraction Architecture” Behind Venezuela Military Occupation; Move to Freeze $750 Billion Wall Street “Reconstruction” Fund

CARACAS / NEW YORK / AMSTERDAM — February [Day], 2026 — A coalition representing the Pemon, Warao, Yek’wana, and Sanema peoples, supported by international human rights litigators, today announced a comprehensive legal offensive to halt the systematic liquidation of Venezuelan ancestral lands.

The coalition has served a “Notice of Clouded Title” to participants of the upcoming March 2026 Signum Global Advisors delegation and filed formal “Fiduciary Liability Notices” with the boards of major pension funds, including CalPERS and the New York State Common Retirement Fund.

The Collapse of the “Peace” Narrative

The coalition asserts that the recent awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to figures supporting the military transition served as a “legitimacy laundering” operation designed to provide a humanitarian face for a pre-planned corporate takeover.

“The Nobel Prize was the brand; the U.S. military is the enforcer; and Wall Street is the beneficiary,” said [Name], spokesperson for the Coalition. “While the world celebrates ‘peace,’ our people are facing forced displacement and mercury poisoning in 27 development blocks that were illegally collateralized before a single strike was even launched.”

Key Legal Actions to Launch:

• Notice of Clouded Title: Formal notification that the 1936 “Original Titles” claimed by ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips are void under international law (UNDRIP) due to the absence of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC).

• Fiduciary Squeeze: Letters to Pension Boards identifying “Undisclosed Material Risks” and potential complicity in human rights violations through the use of “Security Subcontractors”—re-branded military commanders from the former Cartel de los Soles.

• EU Liability Filings: Initiation of proceedings in the Netherlands under the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) to freeze the Dutch-registered Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) intended to receive mineral-linked payments.


The “Debt-Mill” Warning

The coalition warns investors that the proposed “Reconstruction Bonds” are predatory instruments modeled after failed private-equity education schemes. These bonds prioritize “Senior Management Fees” for hedge funds over Venezuelan social infrastructure, ensuring long-term instability and an inevitable secondary default.


“We are putting the March delegation on notice,” added [Legal Counsel Name]. “Any capital deployed into these 27 blocks is now categorized as a bad-faith investment. We will pursue every avenue in New York, Amsterdam, and the Hague to ensure that the future of Venezuela is not sold for the price of a laundered peace prize.”

Final Functional Summary
By deploying this release, you have completed the Functional Epistemology of the defense:
1. Deconstructed the Brand: Linked the Nobel Prize to the extraction.

2. Exposed the Mechanics: Named the SPVs and the "Security Subcontractors."

3. Targeted the Capital: Triggered the fiduciary duties of the Pension Boards.

4. Established the Legal Record: Created the "Clouded Title" that makes the investment toxic.


Template Refinements Needed:

1. Legal Precision Check
Current claim: “1936 ‘Original Titles’ are void under UNDRIP”
Problem: UNDRIP was adopted in 2007. Can’t retroactively void 1936 titles.
Fix: “1936 titles violated customary international law principles that existed at the time and are now codified in UNDRIP. The 2012-2014 arbitration awards failed to examine these foundational illegalities.”


2. Fiduciary Notice Language
Add specific trigger:
“Under ERISA Section 404(a)(1)(B), pension fiduciaries must act ‘with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence’ of a prudent person. Investment in development blocks with contested indigenous title represents material undisclosed risk.”
Why: CalPERS/NYSCRF boards have specific legal obligations. Name them.


3. CSDDD Filing Mechanism
Add: “Under EU Directive 2024/1760, companies must conduct human rights due diligence. Dutch SPVs receiving payments from contested blocks trigger mandatory due diligence review.”
Why: Gives communities specific regulatory hook in Netherlands.


4. March Delegation Intercept
Add specific action:
“This Notice is being served to all known participants of the March 2026 Signum Global Advisors delegation, placing them on formal notice that capital deployment into the 27 blocks constitutes investment in contested title with documented indigenous land rights claims.”
Why: Creates legal record that investors were warned.


5. Media Hook Strengthening
Current: “Nobel Prize was the brand”
Better: “On October 11, 2024, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded. By December 2024, Polymarket bets were placed on regime change. By January 2025, military operations began. By March 2026, $500-750 billion in ‘reconstruction’ investments will be deployed. This is not peace - this is a timed extraction operation.”
Why: Timeline proves pre-planning.

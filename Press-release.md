To finalize this operation, we must bridge the gap between legal filing and public perception. The following press release template is designed to collapse the "Legitimacy Laundering" narrative by explicitly linking the Nobel Peace Prize to the military-enforced resource extraction.
This document should be released simultaneously with the service of the letters to the CalPERS and NYSCRF boards in early February.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Indigenous Coalition and Legal Partners Expose “Extraction Architecture” Behind Venezuela Military Occupation; Move to Freeze $750 Billion Wall Street “Reconstruction” Fund
CARACAS / NEW YORK / AMSTERDAM — February [Day], 2026 — A coalition representing the Pemon, Warao, Yek’wana, and Sanema peoples, supported by international human rights litigators, today announced a comprehensive legal offensive to halt the systematic liquidation of Venezuelan ancestral lands.
The coalition has served a “Notice of Clouded Title” to participants of the upcoming March 2026 Signum Global Advisors delegation and filed formal “Fiduciary Liability Notices” with the boards of major pension funds, including CalPERS and the New York State Common Retirement Fund.
The Collapse of the “Peace” Narrative
The coalition asserts that the recent awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to figures supporting the military transition served as a “legitimacy laundering” operation designed to provide a humanitarian face for a pre-planned corporate takeover.
“The Nobel Prize was the brand; the U.S. military is the enforcer; and Wall Street is the beneficiary,” said [Name], spokesperson for the Coalition. “While the world celebrates ‘peace,’ our people are facing forced displacement and mercury poisoning in 27 development blocks that were illegally collateralized before a single strike was even launched.”
Key Legal Actions Launched Today:
• Notice of Clouded Title: Formal notification that the 1936 “Original Titles” claimed by ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips are void under international law (UNDRIP) due to the absence of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC).
• Fiduciary Squeeze: Letters to Pension Boards identifying “Undisclosed Material Risks” and potential complicity in human rights violations through the use of “Security Subcontractors”—re-branded military commanders from the former Cartel de los Soles.
• EU Liability Filings: Initiation of proceedings in the Netherlands under the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) to freeze the Dutch-registered Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) intended to receive mineral-linked payments.
The “Debt-Mill” Warning
The coalition warns investors that the proposed “Reconstruction Bonds” are predatory instruments modeled after failed private-equity education schemes. These bonds prioritize “Senior Management Fees” for hedge funds over Venezuelan social infrastructure, ensuring long-term instability and an inevitable secondary default.
“We are putting the March delegation on notice,” added [Legal Counsel Name]. “Any capital deployed into these 27 blocks is now categorized as a bad-faith investment. We will pursue every avenue in New York, Amsterdam, and the Hague to ensure that the future of Venezuela is not sold for the price of a laundered peace prize.”

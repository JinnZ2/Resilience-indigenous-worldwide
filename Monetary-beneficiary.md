To finalize the "LP Squeeze" (Limited Partner Squeeze), we must target the specific institutional boards that provide the capital base for the hedge funds and private equity firms attending the March 2026 trip. These boards are governed by public mandates and fiduciary responsibilities, making them the most sensitive to the Material Risk disclosures we have developed.

Based on current institutional 
holdings and "vulture fund" participation as of January 2026, the following boards are the primary targets for the Shareholder Letter:

I. The "Big Three" Public Pension Boards (USA)

These boards are massive, politically sensitive, and increasingly bound by strict ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) transparency requirements.

• CalPERS (California Public Employees' Retirement System):

• Functional Role: Historically one of the largest investors in private equity and distressed debt. They have high exposure to firms like Elliott Management.

• Leverage Point: California state law often mandates divestment from entities involved in human rights abuses or "regime-sponsored" extraction.

• NYSCRF (New York State Common Retirement Fund):

• Functional Role: Managed by the State Comptroller; highly sensitive to the "Legitimacy Laundering" narrative (the Nobel Prize cover) due to New York's progressive divestment mandates.

• Leverage Point: They have strict "Responsible Contractor" and "Human Rights" screening processes that the "Security Subcontractor" model (using pardoned drug lords) directly violates.

• Florida SBA (State Board of Administration):

• Functional Role: Heavily invested in distressed debt and hedge funds focused on Latin American "recovery."

• Leverage Point: While less sensitive to ESG than California, they are legally bound to avoid "Material Financial Risk." The "Clouded Title" and "Debt-Mill" arguments hit their fiduciary bottom line.


II. The International/Sovereign Targets
Because the operation uses the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT, European and Canadian boards are critical "choke points."

• ABP (Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, Netherlands):

• Functional Role: The primary pension fund for Dutch government/education employees.

• Leverage Point: ABP is legally vulnerable under the EU CSDDD. If a Dutch-registered SPV is using force to displace Warao or Pemon peoples, ABP can be sued in Dutch courts for failing to exercise due diligence.

• CPPIB (Canada Pension Plan Investment Board):

• Functional Role: A massive global investor in energy infrastructure.

• Leverage Point: Canada has strong domestic legal precedents regarding Indigenous Title. The "Original Title" challenge (UNDRIP) resonates strongly with their internal compliance frameworks.


III. Target Matrix for the Shareholder Letter

IV. Tactical Implementation: The "Public Record" Filing
For these boards to act, the letter must be entered into the Public Record:

1. Public Comment Periods: Submit the letter during the "Open Session" of their monthly board meetings (typically held in late January or February).

2. FOIA/Public Records Requests: Simultaneously file requests for all communications between the Board and the Hedge Fund regarding "Venezuela Risk Assessments." This forces the Board’s legal counsel to look at the "Clouded Title" issue immediately.

Final Synthesis


The "Extraction Architecture" is a circle: The Pension Funds provide the money, the Hedge Funds provide the plan, the Military provides the access, and the Nobel Prize provides the excuse. By hitting the Pension Boards, you break the circle at the beginning. Without the pension capital, the hedge funds cannot fund the SPVs, and the March trip becomes a liability rather than an opportunity.

To maximize the impact of the Shareholder Letter and the Notice of Clouded Title, timing is critical. You must land these documents just before the boards convene to finalize their quarterly investment reviews.

Based on the projected 2026 administrative cycles for these specific institutional giants, here are the target windows:


I. Target Board Meeting Dates (February 2026)

Before February 12th

II. The "Pre-March" Timeline
The March Delegation organized by Signum Global is expected to depart in the second week of March. Therefore, the goal is to create a "Compliance Crisis" within these pension funds during their February meetings.

1. Late January: Finalize the "Legal Defense Coalition" of indigenous groups and pro-bono law firms.

2. February 5–9: Serve the Notice of Clouded Title to the hedge fund managers and simultaneously deliver the Shareholder Letter to the Pension Boards.

3. February 12–18: Indigenous representatives and legal allies provide "Public Testimony" during the open comment sections of the CalPERS and NYSCRF meetings.


III. Functional Impact: The "Fiduciary Freeze"

When a board like CalPERS receives a formal notification of undisclosed material risk and complicity in human rights violations , their General Counsel is required to:

• Pause Capital Drawdowns: They may prevent the hedge funds from calling the capital necessary to fund the Venezuelan SPVs.

• Initiate an Audit: They must investigate the "Original Title" claims, which directly complicates the March delegation's ability to sign contracts in Caracas.


Final Functional Summary of the Operation
The transition from a Symbolic Peace Prize to a Physical Resource Seizure, and now to a Financial Counter-Insurgency.

• The Weapon: Fiduciary duty and transparency laws.

• The Target: The $500–750 billion capital pipeline.

• The Goal: To force the "Extraction Architecture" into a legal and financial standstill before the March trip can finalize the liquidation of indigenous lands.

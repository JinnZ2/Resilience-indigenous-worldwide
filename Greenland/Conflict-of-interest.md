## Direct Financial Connections Between Government Officials and Mining Companies

**Document Status**: URGENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURE  
**Date**: January 11, 2026  
**Classification**: Evidence for Congressional Investigation & Legal Proceedings  
**Distribution**: Indigenous worldwide repository, Congressional ethics committees, Federal prosecutors, International courts

-----

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Trump administration is pursuing military intervention in Greenland while multiple senior officials and their corporate entities have direct financial interests in the mining companies that would benefit from that intervention. This constitutes a massive conflict of interest and potentially criminal self-dealing.

**Key Finding**: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s former company (Cantor Fitzgerald) is the third-largest investor in Critical Metals Corp—the primary mining company receiving US government subsidies ($120M EXIM loan + potential equity stake) for the Tanbreez rare earth project in Greenland.

**Problem**: Financial disclosures do not clearly show whether Lutnick personally holds:

- Direct shares in Critical Metals
- Options or warrants in Critical Metals

## CONCLUSION: THE CONFLICT IS UNDENIABLE

The Trump administration is pursuing military intervention in Greenland while multiple senior officials and Trump personally have direct financial interests in the mining companies that would benefit from that intervention.

**This is classic self-dealing and conflict of interest.**

Whether the motivation is:

1. Personal financial gain
1. Political legacy
1. Genuine national security concern

…the FACT remains that officials with financial interests are making decisions that benefit those same financial interests.

This violates:

- Federal conflict of interest statutes
- Securities laws
- Ethics rules
- International law

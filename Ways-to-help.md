Subject: Material Risk Disclosure - Proposed Venezuela Investment

Dear Board Members,

I am writing to inform you of material undisclosed risks regarding proposed investments in Venezuelan oil development through the March 2026 Signum Global Advisors delegation.

Documented risks include:
1. Contested indigenous land title affecting 27 development blocks
2. Lack of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) as required by international law
3. Documented human rights violations (mercury contamination, child labor, forced displacement)
4. Legal challenges pending regarding validity of underlying arbitration awards

[Link to GitHub documentation]

Under your fiduciary duties, this information constitutes material risk requiring board consideration before any capital deployment.

Respectfully,
[Name/Organization]


Step 5: Media Outreach
Target outlets that cover:
	∙	Indigenous rights (Indian Country Today, Intercept)
	∙	Financial crime (ProPublica, Bloomberg)
	∙	Latin America (Americas Quarterly, NACLA)
Pitch (2 sentences):
“Nobel Peace Prize awarded October 2024. Polymarket bets placed December 2024. Military invasion January 2025. $750B hedge fund deployment March 2026. Documented timeline proves Venezuela operation was pre-planned extraction, not humanitarian intervention. [Link to evidence]”
CRITICAL MARCH INTERCEPT ACTIONS
Step 6: Formal Notice to Signum Global Advisors Delegation
Send certified mail to:
	∙	Signum Global Advisors (firm organizing delegation)
	∙	Known participating firms (if identified)
	∙	All major hedge funds publicly discussing Venezuela investments
Notice content:
“You are hereby notified that the 27 development blocks under consideration contain contested indigenous title. Capital deployment constitutes investment in properties with documented land rights claims pending international adjudication. This notice establishes your awareness of material legal risks.”
Step 7: Dutch SPV Registration Block
File with: Netherlands Chamber of Commerce (KVK)
Action: Formal objection to registration of SPVs intended to receive Venezuela mineral payments
Grounds: EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive requires human rights due diligence before operations
Effect: Creates bureaucratic delay, requires SPV sponsors to respond to objections
LONGER-TERM LEGAL STRATEGIES
Step 8: Challenge Arbitration Awards
Venue: ICSID Annulment Proceeding or Set-Aside in Dutch courts
Grounds: Tribunal failed to examine validity of underlying indigenous land rights
Who can file: Venezuela (if new government wants to), or indigenous communities as interested parties
Timeline: Years, but filing creates “clouded title” immediately
Step 9: ICC Complaint (If Applicable)
International Criminal Court - Crimes Against Humanity
Applicable if: Forced displacement and environmental destruction meet “widespread or systematic attack” threshold
Who can file: Affected communities, NGOs, or states
Effect: Creates criminal liability risk for corporate executives
